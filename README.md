Hotwheels Treasure Hunt App

This is a passion project of mine to aid my self and other hotwheel collecters in searching for Super Treasure Hunts, Regular Treasure Hunts, and ID Chases.

I made this With little no expeirence in HTML Web Development, Stack overflow was my only hope.

This project helped me learn alot about html, javascript, and CSS styling.

Update - Please do not look at the Javascript 😆 i had never used a switch statement 

## Features I Want To Add

* ID Chases
  * All Option
  * Search Option
  * Every Year of Treasure Hunts
  * Database for keeping track of collection
  * carousel of New popular Premiums
